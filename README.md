# ü§ñ Machine Learning Project Portfolio

This repository contains a curated portfolio of eight machine learning projects demonstrating proficiency across core ML domains, including Classification (Binary, Multi-Class), Regression, and Deep Learning for Computer Vision.

Each project notebook (.ipynb files) details the complete pipeline: Data Loading, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Multi-Model Training, Performance Evaluation, and Visualization.

üìÇ Projects Overview
The portfolio is structured around models built using structured tabular data and a dedicated computer vision task.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Methodologies Demonstrated
Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
Imputation & Handling Missingness: Used median/mode imputation to handle missing values in clinical and commercial datasets.

Feature Transformation: Techniques included mapping circular features (e.g., trigonometric transformation of Aspect) and calculating age features (e.g., car_age).

Encoding & Scaling: Employed OneHotEncoder and OrdinalEncoder for categorical variables, and StandardScaler to normalize numerical data.

Imbalance Handling: Utilized class_weight='balanced' in models for imbalanced tasks (like Lung Cancer Survival) to prioritize meaningful metrics over skewed accuracy.

Multi-Model Comparison and Selection
Every project involved training and evaluating multiple distinct model types to ensure the optimal algorithm was selected based on performance and robustness:

Model Diversity: Comparison included Linear Models (Logistic Regression, Ridge), Instance-Based Models (KNN), and advanced Tree-Based Ensembles (Random Forest, LightGBM).

Model Tuning: Focus on selecting models that generalize well, often relying on Cross-Validation scores.

Evaluation and Visualization
Performance was analyzed using extensive visualizations for true insight:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Used task-appropriate metrics: ROC AUC, F1-Score (Macro), R 
2
 , and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Visual Diagnostics: Comprehensive use of matplotlib and seaborn to generate:

Feature Importance Plots to understand model drivers.

ROC Curves for clear trade-off analysis in binary classification.

Confusion Matrices for detailed error analysis (e.g., False Positives/Negatives).

Distribution and Correlation Plots for initial EDA.

Deep Learning and Transfer Learning
The Animal Classification project demonstrated Transfer Learning, leveraging the pre-trained weights of InceptionV3 to achieve high accuracy quickly, minimizing the need for massive, domain-specific training data.

üöÄ How to Run the Notebooks
Clone the Repository:

git clone [repository-link]

Open in Colab/Jupyter: Upload the desired *.ipynb file (e.g., heart_disease.ipynb) to your Google Colab or local Jupyter environment.

Data: Each notebook is set up to read its corresponding dataset. Ensure your data file is in the same directory or the path is adjusted.

Run Cells: Execute the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the data analysis, modeling, and evaluation pipeline.
